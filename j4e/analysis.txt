Sorted situation
In the case that the array is already sorted, the program would simply
iterate through the array once to read the elements(O(Array Size)). Again since
the array is already sorted no sorting is needed in this case. Therefore the time
complexity for processing a sorted array is O(n).

Unsorted situation
In the case that the array is unsorted, the program would have to sort the array
first using Collections.sort (O(arraySize * log(arraySize))
then iterate through the array once to read the elements(O(Array Size)). However
in my program the sorting operation is not executed in the 'getCandidatePair' function,
so the 'getCandidatePair' function itself remains O(n). Therefore, overall the time
complexity for processing a unsorted array is O(n log n).
