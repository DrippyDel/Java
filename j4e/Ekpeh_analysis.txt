/* COP 3503C Assignment 2
This program is written by: Delali Ekpeh */

The time complexity of this Assignment is O(s * n^2) s being the number of words
I need to find in the matrix and n being the the number of rows and columns in the
matrix. Excluding the 'printWord' function, the nested for loop is used to traverse
the whole matrix in the 'exist' function and would be called s times for each word
that needed to be checked.ÃŸ
